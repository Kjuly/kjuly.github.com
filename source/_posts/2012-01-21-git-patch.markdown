### Generate Patch File:
Generate a patch between two commits:

    git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2 > new_feature.patch

Or just(the easiest way to create a patch for the last commit):

    git show > new_feature.patch

There's also a tool, format-patch, for formatting a patch to send as an e-mail. You can create patches for the last n revisions like this:

    git format-patch -n

If not use `git`, use `diff` command:

    diff -Naur standard_moodle my_moodle > patch.txt

### Apply the Patch:

    git apply new_feature.patch

Or use the `patch` command(releated post: [Linux / Unix Command: patch][]):

    patch < new_feature.patch
